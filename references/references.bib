	abstract = {Natural selection for specific functions places limits upon the amino acid substitutions a protein can accept. Mechanisms that expand the range of tolerable amino acid substitutions include chaperones that can rescue destabilized proteins and additional, stability enhancing substitutions. Here, we present an alternative mechanism that is simple and uses a frequently encountered network motif. Computational and experimental evidence show that the self-correcting, negative feedback gene regulation motif increases repressor expression in response to deleterious mutations and thereby precisely restores repression of a target gene. Furthermore, this ability to rescue repressor function is observable across the Eubacteria Kingdom through the greater accumulation of amino acid substitutions in negative feedback transcription factors compared to genes they control. We propose that negative feedback represents a self-contained genetic canalization mechanism that preserves phenotype while permitting access to a wider range of functional genotypes.},

Therapeutic options are currently being explored that target different steps in the production and processing of proteins implicated in neurodegenerative disease, including synthesis, chaperone-assisted folding and trafficking, and degradation via the proteasome and autophagy pathways. Other therapies, like mTOR inhibitors and activators of the heat shock response, can rebalance the entire proteostatic network. However, there are major challenges that impact the development of novel therapies, including incomplete knowledge of druggable disease targets and their mechanism of action as well as a lack of biomarkers to monitor disease progression and therapeutic response. A notable development is the creation of collaborative ecosystems that include patients, clinicians, basic and translational researchers, foundations and regulatory agencies to promote scientific rigor and clinical data to accelerate the development of therapies that prevent, reverse or delay the progression of neurodegenerative proteinopathies.},

Most neurodegenerative diseases manifest protein toxicity as one of their key pathogenic mechanisms, the details of which remain unclear. By systematically deconstructing the nature of toxic proteins, we aim to elucidate and illuminate some of the key mechanisms of protein toxicity from which therapeutic insights may be drawn. In this review, we focus specifically on protein toxicity from the point of view of various cellular compartments such as the nucleus and the mitochondria. We also discuss the cell-to-cell propagation of toxic disease proteins that complicates the mechanistic understanding of the disease progression as well as the spatiotemporal point at which to therapeutically intervene. Finally, we discuss selective neuronal vulnerability, which still remains largely enigmatic.},

	abstract = {A number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, share intra- and/or extracellular deposition of protein aggregates as a common core pathology. While the species of accumulating proteins are distinct in each disease, an increasing body of evidence indicates that defects in the protein clearance system play a crucial role in the gradual accumulation of protein aggregates. Among protein degradation systems, the endosome-autophagosome-lysosome pathway (EALP) is the main degradation machinery, especially for large protein aggregates. Lysosomal dysfunction or defects in fusion with vesicles containing cargo are commonly observed abnormalities in proteinopathic neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the available evidence for a mechanistic connection between components of the EALP-especially lysosomes-and neurodegenerative diseases. We also focus on lysosomal pH regulation and its significance in maintaining flux through the EALP. Finally, we suggest that raising cAMP and free zinc levels in brain cells may be beneficial in normalizing lysosomal pH and EALP flux.},

	abstract = {General principles of protein structure, stability, and folding kinetics have recently been explored in computer simulations of simple exact lattice models. These models represent protein chains at a rudimentary level, but they involve few parameters, approximations, or implicit biases, and they allow complete explorations of conformational and sequence spaces. Such simulations have resulted in testable predictions that are sometimes unanticipated: The folding code is mainly binary and delocalized throughout the amino acid sequence. The secondary and tertiary structures of a protein are specified mainly by the sequence of polar and nonpolar monomers. More specific interactions may refine the structure, rather than dominate the folding code. Simple exact models can account for the properties that characterize protein folding: two-state cooperativity, secondary and tertiary structures, and multistage folding kinetics--fast hydrophobic collapse followed by slower annealing. These studies suggest the possibility of creating "foldable" chain molecules other than proteins. The encoding of a unique compact chain conformation may not require amino acids; it may require only the ability to synthesize specific monomer sequences in which at least one monomer type is solvent-averse.},

By analyzing a small set of two-state and multi-state proteins with no knots or slipknots, our results show that 95.4\% of the analyzed proteins have non-trivial topological characteristics, as reflected by the second Vassiliev measure, and that the logarithm of the experimental protein folding rate depends on both the local geometry and the topology of the protein’s native state.},

	abstract = {Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone that is conserved from bacteria to humans and facilitates the maturation of substrates (or clients) that are involved in many different cellular pathways. HSP90 clients include, among others, kinases, transcription factors, steroid hormone receptors and E3 ubiquitin ligases.The highly dynamic conformational changes in the HSP90 dimer are regulated by a set of co-chaperones that bind to HSP90, often in different phases of its ATPase cycle. Co-chaperones modulate the rate of ATP hydrolysis by HSP90, stabilize certain conformational states or are involved in client recruitment. Some co-chaperones introduce asymmetry in the symmetric HSP90 dimer.HSP90 binds to clients in different conformations. Novel insights into client maturation have revealed that clients form contacts mainly with the middle domain of HSP90, but also make contacts with the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains.HSP90 clients are functionally and structurally diverse. Within this broad range of clients, intrinsic instability and low folding cooperativity seem to dictate the requirement for the chaperone activity of HSP90.The pleiotropic effects of HSP90 on diverse client proteins means that HSP90 is implicated in many diseases, most prominently cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and infectious diseases that are caused by viruses and protozoa.A number of HSP90 inhibitors have been identified that target the ATP-binding site or the carboxy-terminal domain. A number of these are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.},

Other pathways concomitant with the protein folding process include transcription, translation, post-translational modifications, degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and autophagy. As such, the folding process can go awry in several different ways. The pathogenic basis behind most neurodegenerative diseases is that the disruption of protein homeostasis (i.e. proteostasis) at any level will eventually lead to protein misfolding. Misfolded proteins often aggregate and accumulate to trigger neurotoxicity through cellular stress pathways and consequently cause neurodegenerative diseases. The manifestation of a disease is usually dependent on the specific brain region that the neurotoxicity affects. Neurodegenerative diseases are age-associated, and their incidence is expected to rise as humans continue to live longer and pursue a greater life expectancy. We presently review the sequelae of protein misfolding and aggregation, as well as the role of these phenomena in several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and spinocerebellar ataxia. Strategies for treatment and therapy are also conferred with respect to impairing, inhibiting, or reversing protein misfolding.},
